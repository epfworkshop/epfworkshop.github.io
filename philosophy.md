## Philosophy
*To provide young researchers in East Asia, in particular, with opportunities to share knowledge, build networks, and present their work in the fields of planet formation and exoplanets.*


## Talk Structure: three categories of talks:

### Lecture talks (40 min): 
A new category designed to provide broad overviews of key topics in the field. These talks are intended to guide students and off-topic researchers, giving them a comprehensive understanding of fundamental questions, current challenges, and future prospects. No career-stage limitation is imposed.
Most lecture talks will cover the major topics of the field, while one or two will be selected from interdisciplinary areas to broaden our perspective and keep the total number of participants manageable.

### Invited talks (20 min): 
Primarily for early-career researchers (e.g., postdocs and early-career faculty).

### Contributed talks (15 min): 
No career stage limitations, but we prioritize students and early-career researchers in case the number of applications exceeds capacity.


From the EPF 2027, we take the three-tier talk system. The Lecture talk is basically pedagogical reviews, which is beneficial for all the participants. The main topics should cover the major topics of the exoplanet and planet formation, but we also encourage a special topic at each EPF workshop to add their flavors by selecting interdisciplinary topics such as cosmochemistry, star formation, astrochemistry, and astrobiology.
